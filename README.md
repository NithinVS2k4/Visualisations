# Visualisations

This repository contains various visualizations created using Python and libraries like Matplotlib. These visualizations are designed to explore and present mathematical concepts, physical simulations, and data insights in an intuitive and engaging manner.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Illustrate mathematical and physical phenomena through simulations.
- Experiment with data visualization techniques and animations.
- Provide a platform for continuous learning and creativity in coding.

## Contents

- **Mathematical Visualizations:** Graphs and plots that explore mathematical functions and their properties.
- **Physics Simulations:** Animations and visualizations that simulate physical systems or phenomena.
- **Data Insights:** Plots that represent interesting patterns or insights from datasets.

## Motivation

This project is a collection of my experiments with visualization and simulation. It serves as a creative outlet to combine programming with mathematical and physical concepts in order to understand them at a deeper level.

## Future Updates

- GIFs and PNGs showcasing the results of the visualizations will be added to make the repository more engaging and accessible.
- Additional explanations and use cases for each visualization will be included.

## Notes

Feel free to explore or replicate the visualizations for educational purposes. Contributions or suggestions for new ideas are welcome!
